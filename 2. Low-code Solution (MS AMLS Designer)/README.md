With the **Designer** of AMLS (Azure Machine Learning Studio), I cloned a dataset with existing pipeline and I adapted some parts to make it ready-to-use in this project.

2 text vectorizations are applied:
- Feature hashing;
- N-Grams Feature extraction.

The classification model is a **two-class logistic regression**.
